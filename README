NAME
    Perinci::Sub::property::drops_privilege - Declare that function drops
    privilege during running

VERSION
    version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
     # in your function metadata
     drops_privilege => 'temp'

DESCRIPTION
    Valid values: '', 'temporary' (or 'temp'), or 'permanent' (or 'perm').

    This property declares that function drops privilege (either temporarily
    by setting EUID ($>), or permanently by setting UID ($<)) during
    execution. Usually the function is run by superuser and needs to perform
    things on behalf of normal users.

    This property's wrapper implementation currently does this: If privilege
    is dropped temporarily, make sure that we switch back to superuser.
    Sometimes when the function dies, privileges are not restored, causing
    failure to subsequent operation.
